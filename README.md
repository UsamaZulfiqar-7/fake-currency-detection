# 💵 Fake Currency Detection System (Computer Vision)

This project uses **Computer Vision and Machine Learning** techniques to classify banknotes as **Real or Fake** based on visual features extracted from images.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build an automated system that can detect counterfeit currency using image processing and deep learning techniques, reducing human error and fraud risks.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The system takes an image of a banknote as input.
2. Extracts key visual features using image processing techniques.
3. Uses a trained model to classify the note as **Real** or **Fake**.
4. Displays the prediction along with confidence score.
